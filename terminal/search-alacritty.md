# Searching scrollback in Alacritty

I use [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal emulator. To be honest I am not sure why...  it gets out of my way and seems to be fast enough

Anyway, I wanted to be able to search the scrollback buffer.


That is quite trivial in alacritty., although as I haven't read the manual I struggled to find it.

<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> , as I first tried, does not work, but <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> does.

>Search allows you to find anything in Alacritty's scrollback buffer. You can search forward using Ctrl Shift f (Command f on macOS) and backward using Ctrl Shift b (Command b on macOS).

There is also a Vi mode , with standard vi search

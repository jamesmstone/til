# Swimming pool depth can impact race speed

- In the men's 100-meter breaststroke final at the 2024 French Olympics, no swimmer finished better time then Tokyo Olympics race from 3 years earlier.
- In the women’s 400 freestyle, three former world record holders failed to reach their personal bests, and [Katie Ledecky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky) did not break 4 minutes.
- The swimming pool at Paris La Défense Arena is **2.15 meters deep**, below the recommended **3 meters** by World Aquatics but above the **previous minimum** of **2 meters.**
- Shallower pools may cause “wavy” or choppy water, affecting performance, especially in breaststroke.
